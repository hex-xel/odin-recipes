    <p>This grilled pork tenderloin is cooked over indirect heat and basted with</p>
    <p>barbecue sauce. My family loves when I make this recipe. The pork is always</p>
    <p>tender, juicy, and flavorful! Serve with additional barbecue sauce for dipping.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (1 pound) pork tenderloins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup barbecue sauce, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. </li>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium, indirect heat and lightly oil the grate. </li>
        <li>Season tenderloins with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Place 1/2 of the barbecue sauce into a small bowl for basting; set aside remaining barbecue sauce for serving. </li>
        <li>Cook pork on the preheated grill over indirect heat for 30 minutes. </li>
        <li>Brush pork with barbecue sauce, turn, and brush again, using all sauce in the small bowl. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 15 more minutes. Let pork rest for 10 minutes. </li>
        <li>Slice pork and serve with reserved barbecue sauce.</li>
